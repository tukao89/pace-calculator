**About This Tool**
Pace Calculator is designed to help athletes and fitness enthusiasts accurately calculate their pace and total time for swimming, cycling, and running activities. It can be used to plan training sessions, races, or track progress over time.

**Pace vs. Speed**
Pace is the time it takes to cover a specific distance, usually expressed in minutes per kilometer or mile. Speed, on the other hand, is the distance covered in a specific time, usually expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph).

**How the Pace Calculator Works**
The Pace Calculator allows you to input the distance and time for each sport (swimming, cycling, running) and select a pace option. It then calculates the average pace based on the input values. For swimming and running, the pace is shown as the time per selected unit of distance. For cycling, the pace is shown as speed in km/h. The total time for all activities combined is also calculated and displayed.
